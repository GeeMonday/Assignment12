# Getting Started with Creating a React Component Library

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating and publishing your own custom React component library and hosting it on GitHub.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to do the following in all of your future React projects:

```bash
npm install @my-github-account/my-cool-component-library

import MyCustomComponent from '@my-github-account/my-cool-component-library';

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyCustomComponent />
    </div>
  );
};
```
